# PackCore

PackCore is a companion mod for the Skyblock Enhanced modpacks. The mod is made to enhance the player experience with a seamless and immersive start to the game. The mod provides:

- A **SkyBlock-themed start menu**, bringing a custom touch to your gameplay.
- A **default config setup prompt** on the first launch, ensuring the best settings for your modpack.
- In-game **pop-up** in the main menu with information about the newest updates to the modpack.

The mod is essential to the SkyBlock Enhanced Modpacks. The goal with the mod is to make your Hypixel experience feel like you’re stepping right into a SkyBlock world, not just Minecraft itself.
