# SkyBlock Enhanced – Modern Edition

**SkyBlock Enhanced – Modern Edition** is a modern, pre-configured modpack designed for **Hypixel SkyBlock** on Minecraft **1.21.5**. It combines a huge collection of quality-of-life improvements, performance optimizations, and SkyBlock-specific mods — all in one place.
