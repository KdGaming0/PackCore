# PackCore

PackCore v2.0 is a companion mod for [SkyBlock Enhanced: Modern Edition](https://modrinth.com/modpack/skyblock-enhanced-modern-edition), designed to enhance the player's experience with a seamless and immersive start. This mod provides:

- A **SkyBlock-themed start menu**, bringing a custom touch to your gameplay.
- A **default config setup prompt** on the first launch, ensuring the best settings for your modpack.
- Additional **quality-of-life improvements** to streamline the SkyBlock Enhanced experience.

The mod is essential to SkyBlock Enhanced Modpack, making setup easier and gameplay smoother!

If you are interested in a Modpack for Hypixel Skyblock using this mod, then you can find it [here](https://modrinth.com/modpack/skyblock-enhanced-modern-edition). I have much more than this so I recommend taking a look at the Skyblock Enhanced Modrinth page.
